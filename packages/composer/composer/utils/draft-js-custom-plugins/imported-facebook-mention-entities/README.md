The 'imported-facebook-mention-entities' plugin takes care of annotating Facebook
mentions inside the prepopulated text. Since Facebook mentions can't be told from
plain text because of the lack of text marker, annotating them requires importing
entity data and applying it.

Mentions written by users after the editor loads are handled by draft-js-mention-plugin.
