We use [draft-js-plugins](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins)
as a plugin architecture for draft-js.

A bunch of [great plugins are provided](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins#available-plugins)
and available from npm.

For those cases where a solution isn't already available, we're gladly building
our own, and this folder is where they should sit :)
